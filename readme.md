## README
## Hey, ok, this was a little more of a challenge
## I think the code is not difficult to write itself
## Is pretty easy to think about tictactoe and what has to happen and in what order
## So the logic is simple
## The problem is with the Classes, modules, methods, scopes
## I will upload my solution, I didnt look to any other code
## So after I upload this I will check the solution in TOP and take a look to the walkthrough too
## But what can I say, my game works
## Is not pretty code
## And it should have a different order!

## I changed a few things
## I created a new class call NewGame
## I initialize a new game from there, I think it make it easier to read
## Some methods maybe belong to another class
## But in general the code is much cleaner
## Now it ask at the end if you want to play again
## It could be improve a little more, but for now it will stay this way
