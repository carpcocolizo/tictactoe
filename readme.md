## README
Hey, ok, this was a little more of a challenge
I think the code is not difficult to write itself
Is pretty easy to think about tictactoe and what has to happen and in what order
So the logic is simple
The problem is with the Classes, modules, methods, scopes
I will upload my solution, I didnt look to any other code
So after I upload this I will check the solution in TOP and take a look to the walkthrough too
But what can I say, my game works
Is not pretty code
And it should have a different order!
